Building on FreeBSD
--------------------

Clang is installed by default as `cc` compiler, this makes it easier to get
started than on [OpenBSD](build-openbsd.md). Installing dependencies:

    pkg install autoconf automake libtool pkgconf
    pkg install boost-libs openssl libevent
    pkg install gmake

You need to use GNU make (`gmake`) instead of `make`.
(`libressl` instead of `openssl` will also work)

For the wallet (optional):

    ./contrib/install_db4.sh `pwd`
    setenv BDB_PREFIX $PWD/db4

Then build using:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure BDB_CFLAGS="-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include" BDB_LIBS="-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib -ldb_cxx"
    gmake
